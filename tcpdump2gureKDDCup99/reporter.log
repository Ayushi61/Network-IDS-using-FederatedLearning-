1588220979.651082	Reporter::WARNING	Your trace file likely has invalid TCP checksums, most likely from NIC checksum offloading.  By default, packets with invalid checksums are discarded by Bro unless using the -C command-line option or toggling the 'ignore_checksums' variable.  Alternatively, disable checksum offloading by the network adapter to ensure Bro analyzes the actual checksums that are transmitted.	/usr/share/bro/base/misc/find-checksum-offloading.bro, line 54
1588220979.651082	Reporter::WARNING	The analyzed trace file was determined to contain only TCP control packets, which may indicate it's been pre-filtered.  By default, Bro reports the missing segments for this type of trace, but the 'detect_filtered_trace' option may be toggled if that's not desired.	/usr/share/bro/base/misc/find-filtered-trace.bro, line 48
